* What is Kepler? What is K2?
* Science case and why we care about B stars.
* Bandwidth issues and why we don't have B star postage stamps.
* Historical research and limitations (can only observe at night).
* Outline of general idea behind the technique (with examples and ∂ Sco example).
* Sample contaminated postage stamps (with example non-contaminated postage
  stamp).
* π Sco: reproducing ground based results.
* ∂ Sco: new science and reproducing LPV oscillation (if it works, if not talk
         about further research).
* Collateral data (smear) and futher research.
* c04 and the Pilades (further study and applications).
* Issues and potential improvements.
